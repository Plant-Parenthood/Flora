## Project Description
MVP: A responsive app that enables a user to find hikes either based on current location or a searched location. App will return information about hikes including length, difficulty, and rating as well as distance and drive time from current location, current weather, and camping options. The user has the ability to filter hikes by rating, difficulty and max length. Additionally, the user has the ability to save favorite hikes for later.

## Problem Domain
Frequently outdoor enthusiasts want to find new hikes close to home or in a place that they are visiting. A few apps exist to help them find this information, but none also include weather information for a given period of time and information about the closest campsites.

## Libraries and Frameworks
This app makes use of the following dependencies -
1. Express
2. CORS
3. PG
4. JSON Web Token
4. BCRYPT.js
5. Morgan
6. Superagent
7. dotenv
