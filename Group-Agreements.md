# Conflict plan:

1. What will your group do when it encounters conflict?
    - Use clarifying questions to be sure that the situation is understood
    - Direct addressal, whether on an individual or group scale
    - Assume good faith of people
    - Take time and space when necessary
    - Feel empowered to speak. It’s better for everyone to know if something is up!
    - Come from a place of empathy
2. How will we raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
    - Approach that person in good faith
    - Make sure they feel they have something to work on/contribute
3. What is the process to resolve conflicts/when will it escalate?
    - If we feel that we have spent too much time on the conflict we will seek outside input

# Communication plan:

1. How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
    - Slack
2. What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voices are heard?
    - Morning/afternoon/evening stand-up check-ins
3. How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
    - Regular check-ins, good communication, use of human empathy
    - We had a discussion about our communication styles to make sure everyone has verbally confirmed that they are able to speak up and that others know any “quirks” about their communication styles or preferences
