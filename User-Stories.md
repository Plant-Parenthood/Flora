# User-stories:

1. As a backpacker, I want to be able to plan my drive to a hiking trail and see where I can camp near the trail using the same app rather than using several apps and websites together to plan my trip. (MVP)

2. I am a novice hiker and am looking for some easy hikes near me that are under 5 miles. I want to be able to store the ones that look good to me or that I want to go to in an easy to access location. 

3. I am visiting my folks in Maryland and have never gone hiking where they live now. I am interested in finding some hikes for us to go on that my family can all enjoy.

4. I rarely plan a road trip in advance - instead, I want to drive to the closet location that has good hiking and great weather.  I want easy car camping in a quiet, peaceful location far from RVs.  I don't need amenities like flushing toilets or running water as I prefer a more rustic experience.
