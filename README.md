# Conflict plan:

1. What will your group do when it encounters conflict?
    - Use clarifying questions to be sure that the situation is understood
    - Direct addressal, whether on an individual or group scale
    - Assume good faith of people
    - Take time and space when necessary
    - Feel empowered to speak. It’s better for everyone to know if something is up!
    - Come from a place of empathy
2. How will we raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
    - Approach that person in good faith
    - Make sure they feel they have something to work on/contribute
3. What is the process to resolve conflicts/when will it escalate?
    - If we feel that we have spent too much time on the conflict we will seek outside input

# Communication plan:

1. How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
    - Slack
2. What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voices are heard?
    - Morning/afternoon/evening stand-up check-ins
3. How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
    - Regular check-ins, good communication, use of human empathy
    - We had a discussion about our communication styles to make sure everyone has verbally confirmed that they are able to speak up and that others know any “quirks” about their communication styles or preferences

# User-stories:

1. JBJ, a world renowned stylist and goth, wants to plant a garden of dark plants. She would like an app that will help her find plants that fit their aesthetic needs. Searching a library of plants for dark purple or black flowers and fruits, and being able to save them for later reference, will help her achieve her goals. (MVP)

2. Tess, a plant novice, is riddled with guilt for all of the plants that die in her care. She wants a resource that helps her know how much to water her plants and how often, as well as any other information regarding plant care (light preferences, soil needs, etc.) She’d like to be able to search a catalogue of plants, save those plants that she has in her care, and refer to her list of plants to reference their need and care. (MVP)

3. Tali is concerned with the global tragedy of the dying off of bees. She’d like to learn what plants are good for bees and other pollinators. However, she’s very busy binge watching code school reality tv, so spending ample time caring for a lot of plants is out of the question. She’d also like to know which plants are native to her area so that she can plant them knowing they’ll require less care and attention. (Stretch)

4. Dan lives in a house where all his room mates are plant lovers. New plants are being brought into the household often. With so many different types of plants there are a lot of different plant care needs in the home. In order to help him and all his room mates, Dan would like a calendar that keeps track of the plants in his home, when they were last watered, and when they are due to be watered next. (Stretch)

5. Lisa wants to get people in her community more excited about plants! She thinks a great way to spread the joy of plants would be to help people share their extra plants. She’d like a forum for plant exchange that would allow people to post what plants they have extra of. People in her community could log onto the forum to browse what plants are available, or post plants of their own to the plant exchange. (Stretch)

6. Brittany thinks it’s great that she can save which plants she already has, but she’d like the ability to save multiple lists of plants that she could label. This would allow her to save a list of plants she likes, a list of plants she wants to avoid, or any other list(s) that she can think of. (Stretch)

7. Naomi travels a lot and loves to visit nurseries. She’d like an app that uses geodata to find nearby nurseries she can check out, as well as learn about what types of plants do well in her area. (Stretch)

8. Tommy is a techno-geek and loves combining his hobbies with technology. Lately he’s been really into house plants and Raspberry Pi’s. He wants an app that can utilize data (such as light and humidity levels) from his Raspberry Pi to tell him what plants would be best for him to have in certain parts of his house or garden. (Stretch)
